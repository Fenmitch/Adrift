A loud hiss pierces your ears, it jolts you awake.
You feel your heartbeat quicken and sweat on your palms.
Your eyes burn as the gas around you fills your vision.
The mist is freezing on your bare skin and burns your slowly opening eyes.

As the gas begins to dissipate your mind also begins to clear.
The clear polymer door in front of you slowly lifts.
You step from the cryopod.
	
The year is 3174. The Earth is warming beyond the point of habitability
A century ago The UN named you caretaker of the Intent.
A ship bound for Alpha Centauri B. The nearest potentially habitable star.
You only should have been woken in an emergency. Something is wrong...
